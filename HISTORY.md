## 3.2.0

* Added
  * CLI endpoint `cyclonedx-node` is now available. ([#193] via [#197])  
    Already existing `cyclonedx-bom` stayed as is.
* Fixed
  * CLI no fails longer silently in case of errors. ([#168] via [#210])  
    Instead the exit code is non-zero and a proper error message is displayed.
